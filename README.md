    This is a simple, freshly started e-commerce ski-rental demo page that I'd like build using React .
    My aim is to create 3 pages :
            > PLP - product listing page, a.k.a. category page
            > PDP - product description page, a.k.a. product page
            > Cart page + Cart overlay (minicart)
            
    
    My goal is to learn, practice and be a bit more confident around React .
    
    Productive coding everyone! :)
